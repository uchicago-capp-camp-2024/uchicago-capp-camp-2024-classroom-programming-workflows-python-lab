# CAPP Camp Python Lab

The goal of this lab is to help you become more comfortable with working with Python.

Since you are not expected to know how to write Python at this point this can feel challenging, but for this lab focus on what we've covered and feel free to discuss with peers.

In this lab you will be trying to get a program running.

## Tips

- The focus of this lab is on the workflow we discussed: run the code, see an error, diagnose & fix, repeat.
- Remember, the '#' character is a comment. You'll notice VSCode colors everything after that on a line line differently. Code following a '#' is not run.
- Try to do this without relying too much on external resources or tools, you of course can and will use those in the future, but for today- practice with what is in front of you.
- Don't let the fact that you likely do not understand the code yet get in your way, focus on the error messages you receive and they'll guide you to working code.
- Feel free to experiment and make changes to the code to better understand it! You can always use `git diff` and `git revert` to undo those changes as needed.

## Part 1 - Fixing Typos

There are two intentional typos in the code you've been given that you'll need to fix.

To find these, try running the code via `python3 game.py` and look at the errors you get.

Do this until you see no more errors and are able to play a round of the game.

## Part 2 - Runtime Error

The code should now start to run, but depending on what letter you pick it may crash.

Try guessing the letter "r" and see what happens.

## Part 3 - Second Runtime Error

There's another condition that will reveal a mistake.
For this one, we won't give you the exact condition right away, experiment with different input.

Thoroughly testing your program is a skill in and of itself.

Consider the different things that the program does, track your guesses, what letters have already been guessed, etc. Have you explored all of them?

If you'd like a hint take a look at hint3.md.

## Part 4 - Logic Errors

Note: This portion may feel like a bit of a stretch if you have never written code before, don't worry if that's the case for you & your partner.

Not all errors in code result in an error message, sometimes the code just does the incorrect thing and continues happily along.

You have likely already noticed that the word does not change between runs of the game.
Read through the code and see if you can determine the mistake.

Hint: Perhaps the original author disabled something to help them test their own code.

## Submission

We ask that you submit the assignment to Gradescope at the end, this will both give you practice with Gradescope and help us see how people fared (strictly for the purposes of revising this assignment for future camps).
